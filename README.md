# Generative AI for Hardware Design - Summer 2024

###  Getting Started & Onboarding Instructions

1. Formally make your acceptance in cohort spreadsheet, provide GitHub handle, and provide weekly availablity in spreadsheet.
2. Follow the development environment install instructions in the  `docker` directory [README](https://github.com/ShvetankPrakash/GenAI4HW/blob/main/docker/README.md).
3. Select task to being working! 
4. Don't forget our daily labeling :)


### Best Practices 
- Make sure you are doing any engineering work on the development branch of your cohort.
- For the majority of folks, code will be written in Python for implementing tasks. Please adhere to [Python's style guide](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/).
- To merge your code with main when ready, submit a pull request. 2 reviews are required (one from cohort, one from leadership team).
- Each cohort will have their own consistent conda environment managed via their environment.yml in their cohort directory.
- When adding libraries to your environment, make sure that make sure to add it to environment.yml with exact version of packages installed.
